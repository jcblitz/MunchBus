# MunchBus

Because 'LunchBus' was already taken

## Purpose

I wanted to play with Angular.js without having to introduce it into a project I'm already working on. The goal of this project is to learn. If I (or you) have learned something...good!

## The Application 

Some time in 2006 I had the idea of coming up with a system to figure out who is going out to lunch, where they are going, and if they have room to take people with them. This application will be that (or some flavor of it)

## Architecture

It's simple. I'm using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) for the front end application and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) to provide a REST API for the datastore (probably [ActiveRecord](http://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord) and Sqlite3). There is also [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), and some other things sprinkled in as needed.

This isn't meant to be a fully baked application, just something to get my feet wet. 

## Contributions 

By all means, fork away and issue pull requests. I hope we can all learn something. If you're interested in trying to implement a piece of functionality, let me know so we don't duplicate efforts. At some point I'll document the "grand vision" of what this is.
